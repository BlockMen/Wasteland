About
~~~~~
This mod adds zombies to Minetest.

Zombies can spawn to every day-time in the world as long there is not to much light.
So you will find some in caves, dark forests and ofc a lot at night. If they notice you they will attack.
Zombies have 20 HP (like players) and drop rotten flesh randomly.

They can't harm you in your house (in case there is no door open). If it becomes day both mobs will take damage
by the sunlight, so they will die after a while.

Notice: Weapons and tools get damaged when hitting a zombie. The wearout is calculated on the damage amout
of the tools/weapons. The more damage they can do that longer they can be used.

Example: 
- Diamond Sword: 1500 uses
- Wooden Sword: 30 uses
