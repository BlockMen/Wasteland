WASTELAND - a game for the Minetest game engine
===============================================
Version 0.2.1

A long time ago there where trees, grass and the ocean. But that is all gone, everything that is left is a WASTELAND and 

YOU.


How to play: 
------------
Your only chance to survive are the ruined houses you can find in the world. There you can find
usefull stuff to survive: Food, water, seeds and even saplings. But you wont find that in every ruin.
Some contain just food and just rarely you can find water or sapling.
Seeds can rarely be dropped when digging the dry shrub, wood can be get from the dead trees or from ruins.
Sand with minerals can be found in the dry out oceans which can be used to grow wheat, grass or trees faster.
If you die there will be a grave with your stuff, also there are very (!) rarely spawning graves with stuff.

Keep in mind, you must eat or you will starve. And hunger comes faster than you think.
